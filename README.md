# Simple Python Calculator

This is a simple command-line calculator program written in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts one number from another.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides one number by another with handling for division by zero.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to choose an operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
2. The user is asked to input two numeric values.
3. The program validates the inputs and checks for any errors (e.g., non-numeric inputs or division by zero).
4. It performs the selected operation and displays the result.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x or later.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-python-calculator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd simple-python-calculator
   ```

3. Run the `calculator.py` file using Python.

   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to perform calculations.

## Example Output

```text
Welcome to the Simple Calculator!
Select operation:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
Enter choice (1/2/3/4): 1
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
The result is: 15.0
```

## Error Handling

- **Invalid Input**: The program checks for invalid number inputs and alerts the user if something non-numeric is entered.
- **Division by Zero**: If the user attempts to divide by zero, the program displays an error message.
